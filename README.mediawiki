== XML Doclet ==
XmlDoclet is a Doclet (i.e. plugs into Javadoc) and produces documentation in XML instead of HTML as Javadoc does.    This XML can be used for a variety of purposes like:
* Produce a better looking HTML documentation than the one that has not changed since late 90s.
* Add information that is presently not captures or thrown away and make the docs more useful
* Use this for analysis / generating code.

=== Building ===

XmlDoclet has an ANT build.xml which can be used to build the jar from source.
Before you build it, make sure you have [http://www.scala-lang.org Scala] V 2.8 or better installed.

=== Running ===

Before you run Javadoc make sure you have the XmlDoclet.jar and scala-library.jar in the classpath.
Invoke Javadoc as usual, even if you are invoking from inside Ant with the additional commandline parameters
<pre>
  javadoc -doclet com.dineshv.XmlDoclet.XmlDoclet ...other parameters
</pre>

In case XmlDoclet.jar is not on the classpath you can add the commandline parameter -Docletpath path/to/XmlDoclet.jar
